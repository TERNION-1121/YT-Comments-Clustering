    "From India West California Newspaper  March 21, 2022 By AMJAD AYUB MIRZA\r\n(Mirza is a human rights activist from Mirpur in PoJK. He currently lives in exile in the UK)\r\nKashmir Files’ Reveals Tip Of The Iceberg\r\n\r\nThe movie released in India called ‘The Kashmir Files‘ is a brave attempt to reveal the atrocities committed by the Pakistan sponsored Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front and other Jihadi proxies and with conformity of a significant number of local Islamists in the Valley of Kashmir.\r\n\r\nThe atrocities were executed against the indigenous Hindu minority living in Kashmir during the 1990 and led to the genocide and forced exodus of nearly 500,000 Kashmiri Hindu Pandits from the Valley.\r\n\r\nHowever, what the movie reveals is like peeling the first lay of the onion. The genocide of the Kashmiri Hindus, in modern day and age, did not begin in 1990 in the valley. It goes way back to when Pakistan army attacked the independent state of Jammu and Kashmir on Oct. 22, 1947.\r\n\r\nAt the time of partition of India, Jammu and Kashmir territories occupied by Pakistan today (PoJK) had a thriving Hindu and Sikh population. The table below gives a breakdown of the Hindu and Sikh demography in several districts in PoJK in 1941.\r\n\r\nA survey conducted by Snedden and published in 2012 mentions that “there are no estimates of Hindus or Sikhs left today in the region and the entire population is assumed to have either been expelled or killed”.\r\n\r\nThe report, widely quoted by research scholars, conforms that they were not able to find a single Hindu or Sikh in the entire region of PoJK. It is estimated that around 122,500 Hindus and Sikhs went missing from PoJK during and after 1947 invasion of PoJK.\r\n\r\nLet us not forget that thousands of Hindus and Sikhs had fled the communal riots in Punjab and had seek sanctuary in today’s PoJK towns bordering Punjab. This resulted in the number of Hindus and Sikhs in PoJK in 1947 to swell. For instance, Bhimber received at least 2000, Mirpur 15,000, Rajouri 5,000 and Kotli an unaccounted number of Hindu and Sikh refugees.\r\n\r\nThe Hindu population in Bhimber tehsil was 35 per cent. None have survived the 1947 Pakistan sponsored Hindu-Sikh genocide. But the worst atrocity, to my knowledge, was committed in my hometown of Mirpur where 25,000 Hindus and Sikhs were rounded up, mutilated, shot and beheaded and our women raped by ‘Allah O’ Akbar’ chanting Pakistan army and religious fanatic members of Lashkar.\r\n\r\nTo this day November 25 is observed as Mirpur (Massacre) Day by the family members of those who were lucky to reach Jammu. On that ill-fated day in 1947 Pakistan army and the mercenary tribal Lashkar entered Mirpur setting on fire several parts of the city, burning down shops and houses of ‘Kafir’.\r\n\r\nA couple of days before the fall of Mirpur, a convoy of 2,500 Hindu and Sikh had managed to make their escape along with the state troops of Jammu Kashmir and reach Jammu safely. Those who were left behind were rounded up and marched to Ali Baig where the invaders said that a Gurdwara had been converted into a refugee camp.\r\n\r\nWhat was thought to be a march to safety soon turned into a death march as the Pakistan army and members of the mercenary Lashkar killed over 10,000 Hindu and Sikh along the way. They abducted a further 5,000 of our women most of who were the sold in the bazars of Rawalpindi, Jhelum and Peshawar.\r\n\r\nOut of 25,000 Hindu and Sikh captives, only 5,000 made it to Ali Baig. However, the killing and rape of the captive men and women continued unabated by their prison guards. Only 1,600 were later rescued by the International Committee of Red Cross who brought the survivors to Rawalpindi and transferred to Jammu.\r\n\r\nBy 1951, only 790 non-Muslims were alive out of a total population of 114,000 Hindu and Sikh in PoJK. Today there are none. The Mirpur massacre death toll is put over 20,000. Many women committed suicide by consuming poison or by jumping over a cliff. Similarly, numerous men also committed suicide.\r\n\r\nThe genocide of Hindus was repeated in Rajouri, Baramulla, Muzaffarabad, Bhimber just to mention a few and continues to this day in Kashmir. The movie ‘The Kashmir Files’ has just revealed the tip of the iceberg. The horror of the Hindu genocide is far more deep-rooted and horrific than it might seem on a silver screen.",

    "I want to share one story related to the movie involving me ...I recently went at a barber shop just days before going to watch the movie ..I was so much exited that I even started talking about it to the barber ( he had no idea about it ) ...he later asked me \"Bhai aap bhi pandit ho \" ..to which I replied bhiya pandit ni but Hindu to hu na and trust me he also had a wide smile after hearing this ( he was also probably a proud Indian ) and said he will also surely watch it ...\nIm glad that people are now realising what our history was and why we should always remember it",

    "There is only solution to Kashmiri Pandit's problems. Revoke the \"Roshni Act\" which snatched the properties of those KPs who fled Kashmir. Provide security to them. Provide them high tech arms and make them resettle in Kashmir with full respect.",
    "Many people didn't knew or *believed* what happened to Kashmiri pandits and it's quite understandable why. majority people see Kashmiri pandits as high caste pandits and well off peoples. so i think it's the bias that makes it hard for people to believe that something Terrible would have happened to them. like i have also seen this thing around me that people can't believe the movie because of the Bias",
    "Government kiski thi us time per you should know about I ever heard interviews of kashmiri pandits saying they were saved by muslims I bet you have never saw that interview it was a political war both Hindus aur muslims suffered at time and what's the Modi Government is doing they are still being killed but no one is raising that because they want to blame the congress Government",

    "Yes the movie has show all factual terrible things happened with kashmiri pandits.....but other half of the movie is propoganda.... Article 370 removal has nothing to do with kashmiri pandit genocide. It was done situations caused in POK & COK.

    "Samay should share his grandparents and parents story on YouTube",
    "Being a Kashmiri Pandit myself I must say that what has been shown is just the surface of what perpetrated against Kashmiri pandits. Obviously it's impossible to show every incident on screen within 3 hrs, still what Vivek Agnihotri has done is unparallel. Like one person had said , \"ispe 7 lakh filme bn skti hai, kunki har kisi pandit ki kahani hai ye' and like what samay said, what was most disheartening was the fact that our people, a common Indian doesn't even have any idea of what actually we had to go through and then they have the audacity to call it a propaganda.",
