    "Our Mission is Simple: Get More People on Bikes!\nThe bike spaces was founded in 2000 as one of Tampa County's very first Schwinn shops. It is rumored that our store in Tampa was home to some of the first mountain bikes in the country. Cycling has changed dramatically as the decades have rolled by, but The Bike Spaces has never wavered from our total dedication to the sport.\nToday, The Bike Spaces is a growing family of bike shops, all with a singular purpose - to get as many people on bikes as possible. We operate twelve wildly successful stores in Tampa and Paris! Our professional staff of over 20 cycling enthusiasts will ensure that your experiences both in the store and on your bike are the best they can be.\nWhy shop with us? Because we know bikes and we care. We don't sell snowboards, we don't sell kayaks and we don't sell tents. We only sell bikes - you might even say bikes are our life. Why does that matter? Because this utter fanaticism for our product makes us the best at what we do - We live to create cyclists.",

Even worse, what if it's let's say not overloaded now because developer noticed nobody used that overload capabilities, so he simplified the code, but my fresh branch uses that overloading in 2% of use-cases? It would create a nightmare scenario that requires thousands of people to maintain a large codebase, while if they weren't able to work in parallel in my opinion, they would work like 60% slower, but the code would need half the people to maintain it, what would save companies millions as maintenance lasts way more time than development.

Seldom is found,\n so many awesome styles and tracks all in one album. 17 song tracks with\n a whopping 55:24 minutes of pure musical enjoyment.\n\n  ChrisP Gavin's first album ( release-2015 'Live To Play' )  was a\n European, Australia success. It is still a mystery for the amount of\n sales success and large amassed following , there was little impact or\n coverage of ChrisP's album here in the U.S. of A. \n\n ChrisP's private Label;  'Buddy Boo Records' was said to have been too\n much of a distraction for other Major Labels.  Which made air time and \npromotional avenues a bit too risque for the competition.\n\n  \"No-One Plays Guitar Like I Do\" will be available at more that 200 \ndigital and physical locations throughout the continental America's ,\n Canada,  Europe , Australia , India and Asia.",

I see there are guidelines for bullying and being mean?\n\nI do not understand why people in your community would want to destroy a person's only way to make a living after a severe injury which is helping clients get their properties repaired after fires floods and storms.\n\nIf anyone knows the answers to my questions, or if you can direct me to an email that I could contact someone to discuss this that can explain if I did something wrong or if peiple in your community did something unethical to me and you would like to see that people suffering out in the world do not get picked on by people in your community and or some assistance, my backup laptop could be unlocked still be unhacked they chabged the passcode,\n\nCan you please send me any emails to the people in Git that can assist me?\n\nPlease and thank you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Claim Handler",
