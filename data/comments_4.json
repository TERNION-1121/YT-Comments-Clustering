    "almost all of the statements regarding why you \"need\" math for programming are completely wrong. Yes, the mathematical concepts require mathematical knowledge IF (and only if) the task is re-invent the wheel. But .... here's the thing : reinventing the wheel almost always is a very, VERY bad idea - especially in the cryptography world but also 3D graphics because actual 3D-graphics developers almost always use libraries and frameworks for exactly that purpose. And if the goal is to write a new engine altogether (which actually is dumb, most of the time) its very possible to lookup the formulas and simply apply them (correctly) without any further involvement ;-)\nThe more you know.",

In that case, forget about math, since you don't know how to implement it in programming, despite knowing. Because if you try to apply the different formulas to real world (or programming) and can't understand it at all how implementing the formula even works even if it is the correct formula, programming with math requires you to implement the math, not just copy and paste the numbers of math into another mathematical equation, which in that case, you would go nowhere. I can say that memorising math is the easiest way to get good grades in elementary - highschool for calculus if you can memorize, but if you manage to memorize all mathematics, it will truly be useless in the end in all fields, except for teaching others about mathematics, which only requires you to know about math.

    "Sorry, but here's why this is silly: Whatever the domain of your code is: That's what you need to know. If it's math, you need to know the requisite math. If it's accounting, you need to know the requisite areas of accounting. I mean, it's that simple. I was forced to take 3 semesters of calculus 34 years ago, for my computer science degree (I had already been programming for 8 years). Know how many times I've used calculus in my 42 years as a software engineer?  Once. And not because I had to, but because I chose to. We had engineers who actually did most of the math in that company, and I could have easily asked one to do it for me.\nBut that was years after I had taken and forgotten calculus. I simply relearned what I needed for that particular work. But my entire career as a software engineer (across many fields) has been all about learning whatever it is that I need to know for what I'm working on. When I was a consultant in Army logistics, I learned about Army logistics. When I worked in wireless engineering, I learned about wireless. When I worked for a trucking company, I learned about trucking. When I worked for a chicken processor, I learned about chickens. Now, working for a credit bureau, I'm learning about credit bureaus. I mean, that's kinda the job.\nBeing an effective programmer isn't so much about being good at programming. I mean, that certainly helps, but most of the programming stuff isn't that challenging. It's about being good at learning. Learning whatever you need to. Programming is only a part of what programmers have to do.",

    "\"Separates a good coder for the 1% of time you need it\". Sounds like being a master of the other 99% isn't worth much :P. The thing is, you don't need to know math to do this unless you do it everyday. In the 1% of cases where you need it (which has never happened in my entire professional career spanning over 10 years), your company can either hire a contractor, use an existing library, or have someone spend a few months learning the math necessary to figure it out and then explain it to the rest of the company once a prototype or the project is complete.\n\nNow I don't think you're being super serious about math in the video, but I'm not sure. The big takeaway for me from working in the industry is that code quality is super important. That's the big separator because it allows you or anyone else to actually work in the code you've written. The worst thing you could do is create black-box math projects like this where the code is a donut shape (super cool though) that no one can work with.\n\nLastly, I think your teaching of how this math works is superb!

Even then i didn't need to know the specifics, just the practical idea of what those could do for me. My understanding of the subject broke down when i was trying to sample those sine waves and store their value in an array to use deep learning within frequency modulation to create a adaptive  predictive model of realtime stock performance.

    "I think the problem with math taught in school is the theoretical part. No one explains what all this crazy math is used for.  It feels so defeating.  The math requirements imo, are too rigorous when you get to college.  I think basic math up to some entry level algebra is fine. But anything heading into upper intermediate college level algebra for non stem majors is just counter productive.  Instead, there should be a class of math history/theory overview that explains what and how algebra, calculus, linear algebra, various types of math are used for.  This way, the mystery of math is uncovered and maybe the students will spark an interest in  math instead of always running away in fear.  The whole system is just wrecked. Since I was in elementary school, math was always put on the back burner.  Then you get to college and you're stuck.  Lots of people end up in the same boat.  It really speaks volumes about our failed near sided, result based only school systems.",

Very detailed books, exercises and courses on them are everywhere.\n2) I find myself using a ton of the mathematical theory in day-day system design and analysis. On average, applying it once-twice a week or so\n3) I've been able to unlock some seemingly hard problems with the math (cryptography problems using group theory, implementing challenging core algorithms using category theory, ML using stats/probability) \n4) It's allowed me to more deeply understand the concepts driving evolution of computing allowing me to steer my entrepreneurial efforts towards more profitable ends.\n\n\nI'd agree also that it's not absolutely necessary to be successful.

It can be harder to find a formula when you don't know it exists, or what it is called, but Google is pretty amazing about finding them in question form. Only after the same problem comes up, and using the same solution many times does a particular formula really stick with me, so I don't have to look it up. \n\nThe main trick about the math part, is I often need to at least think about it on my own enough to understand what mathematical question I'm looking for the answer to. To use and modify code, you probably don't need much math at all. If you actually want to design systems that aren't ready-made functions in order to do more than whatever libraries you're using already provide, it comes up a lot. My advice: Don't aimlessly study math before programming. Go straight to programming, and you'll learn the math as you go when each problem comes up.",

BUT if you did decide to listen to ME then set theory is kinda useful if you want to write SQL ( but I think they teach that stuff to third graders now anyway ). I really hope for the sake of the species these math people figure how to teach their stuff more effectively - like how actually to apply it, and why the hell you'll care in the first place - it seems a much more honest approach than wasting peoples lives with the BS they rammed down our necks in the 80s.

Plus not all programs use rotation matrices, some using Quartenions aka Unity. \n\nThere are some merits to knowing maths and yes when drawing scales or making oscillators if you'll need those you will need this but realistically, the math you ACTUALLY need does not go past far simpler matrices and differentiation.

Expressing some concepts using text may need an absurd long text to fully explain the concept without being ambiguous. But with the math language it could be a simple formula. The exercises you need to resolve at school and university are like the texts you need to write and read to learn a new language. When some people learns english, it's common the write stuff like \"the book is on the table\", or stuff like that. These phrases are useless in the real life but have a purpose. The same is with math. You need to see it as a language, just like english, french or portuguese.

Unless you code something that is mostly math, then you have to figure it out yourself. But it's nothing wrong with colab with other specialities. I wrote code for sysadmins, they helped me with configuring the servers. I don't have much accounting knowledge, so when I do accounting in code I again colab with pros. They know how it should work, I know how to code it. Of course most of the pros in various fields can code a little themselves. Mostly enough for their needs. Most coders also dig some basic math, enough for most of the work. When we need more, we either learn or just ask more competent guys.",

    "@Joma Tech, great video -  I think the issue for people is not that they don't know the math, but that they've been so far abstracted from the math in their lives that implementing it in such a new (and strict) way is difficult for them. From my discrete maths class, set theory essentially explained a lot of the concepts of basic math and algebra... The new concepts like countable and uncountable infinities, Big-O, matrices, and propositional logic, are the only curveballs.",
    "It's important to know that remembering math is not as important as being able to learn/re-learn math on the fly..  It's like knowing about an API then you saw that it solves the problem you are trying to solve, even though you don't have in-depth knowledge about it there is still the opportunity to learn more and implement it.  Being able to observe and find patterns within certain problems, which have parameters that fit into a certain branch of math, is the most important part about understanding math.  Some people start solving problems in a certain area and are eventually sent back to school, to study that particular problem, while some even go back and perform graduate research out of passion and interest.  Therefore, do not sit up and burn yourself out on this subject.  I have spent many years studying certain types of math out of passion and there are certain solutions that require time...sometimes you just have to agree that the solution just works that way.  You could learn cryptography and end up working in data analysis or you could learn statistics and probability and end up working on encryption algorithms.  To refrain from being long-winded, math is not a list to check off, it is a collection of looking glasses, which show intense beauty of the surrounding world once you put them in focus.\n\nI once found the solution to a Facebook interview problem (a friend's interview), which wanted to fill the width of a sidewalk with rain drops.  Long story short, I quickly found the solution by using a Real Anaylsis property of continuity: if there are two distinct vectors (a,b) and (c,d) and b >= c, then the two segments are connected and continuous.  I know how to program but all that did was allow me to organize my helper functions and execute the solution in code.  Therefore, if anyone has come this far then I will leave a list of math that some forgo in a cs degree, but I believe these to be very helpful in problem solving:\n\nAbstract Algebra: Group Theory, Field Theory, Abelian Rings, Patterns and groupings of matrix multiplication.\nNumerical Analysis: Greatly varies but the Runge-Kutta methods, Richardson Extrapolation, Newtonian Interpolation.\nReal Analysis: Continuity, Compactness, Neighborhoods, Point-Set Topology, etc.\nGeometry: All Euclidean Geometry is probably the most abstract yet concrete methods of proof, very worthwhile to read about.\n\nDifferential Geometry: There is a lot of stuff and you really can't go wrong with looking at any of it, but if you don't understand anything within a reasonable amount of time, then there is probably another mathematical pre-requisite you are missing.\n\nIf you missed any of these subjects then I would say every hour invested into any of these categories would be worth 10 hours of programming.  \"But programming is king!\", programming is how we communicate to computers but why hack your way through a jungle with a machete, when you could fly?  Math is such a powerful tool, which allows you to anchor a team of engineer, to allow the team passage through the seemingly massive roadblock.  I also must say yes, Joma is not Jesus, but hopefully anyone who reads this will consider the claims that Jesus is God and considers that he loves you, and died for your sins.  \n\nMay you be well and enjoy the art of problem-solving.",

    "Always have hated when some people, who study math arround me in school or university, say \"i will never use that, why to study all of this\". Well the answer is so simple: In most cases you don't study math to get information you will probably use. You study to learn how to think logically. How to specialise and generalise. You learn how to split a big problem in pieces of problems. You learn how to deal with these problems based on experience of dealing simillar problems. You learn that anything could be right or wrong if its not proven, which helps for analysing the borderline cases of problems(checking out all possible cases so you end up with 0 or 1 in any case). It helps in life for sure, but it is also mandatory for people on job positions- creating or supporting applications and softwares, maintenance of computer systems. Alot of people working in the sphere are just workers, also called coders(sometimes called junior developers or programmers)- missing algorithmic knowledge, writing piece of code given by developers, fixing known problems with known fixes. Without possibility to raise their level in the working environment. So i think that it is a fundamental knowledge for people in the sphere and it is irreplaceable knowledge for everyone.",

For some random stuff like geometry and matrices also high school math is enough, and so you still won't need math on a university level for 99,5% issues. Still I have to admit that it's a nice joke in the beginning. Fun fact: People that can solve 99% of the issues at work are still above average, because many coders aren't even able to write (long term) structured and maintainable code. In addition: Only a rare amount of people is needed at the top (just like with managers).

    "As a programmer myself, I totally agree that understanding of math is important if we want to become a good programmer. By knowing basic math, we basically already learnt two basic fundementals of programming, basic aritmathics and conditionals.\n\nI know this video was suppose to be a joke, or at least not one with serious tone, but kudos for you. You did great explaining the mathematic formulas behind this majestic rotating donut.",
