Let's say I used a function from a library to make my code faster, but that library got updated a few minutes after I merged it. Even worse, what if it's let's say not overloaded now because developer noticed nobody used that overload capabilities, so he simplified the code, but my fresh branch uses that overloading in 2% of use-cases? It would create a nightmare scenario that requires thousands of people to maintain a large codebase, while if they weren't able to work in parallel in my opinion, they would work like 60% slower, but the code would need half the people to maintain it, what would save companies millions as maintenance lasts way more time than development.

Sorry to bother recently I have been hacked by people in your community they have destroyed one of my laptops and the other is now locked.

For me just waking knowing that I can barely walk how iam I gonna get thru this day when I am in the roofing industry. If you can imagine anything worse.\n\n\n\nAfter I figured out how to find the codes and after both my laptops were made non functional. One is destroyed and the other is locked (any help would be greatly appreciated)\n\nI believe now that I woufd have been able to see the handles/ login names of the persons haking my pc.\n\nAfter they locked my backup laptop last night I received information from the community regarding licensing and or copy write information with regards to the rre authoring/re sale of literature that I have studied and saved to my laptops.\n\nAnd on the cloud.\n\nDoes anyone know if you guy have a policy to hack people who are downloading history information online? Also I only read and study the information and copy things into my notes that I want to say like when ai pray to The Good Lord. Most of what I study is history about God and ancient Egypt etc. I do not re sell any information.\n\nCan you please let me know an email to contact anyone there if what I am describing is not a fair and ethical thing for peiple in your community to do to others people like me?\n\nAlso,\n\nIf anyone knows if I broke any rules or laws regsarding researching history for my own personal study and making personal notes with my studys for prayer reasons can you please let me know that also.\n\nI do not re author or sell resell any information that I have went online to research.\n\nI do download it and copy and past it in my notes on my cell phone under the titles that I can search to find when I want ro pray or say a particular sentence so if anyone knows that is breaking rules laws etc. Can you please let me know that as well?\n\nThat being said do any of you know:\n\nIf this is a normal practice for people In your community to do? I see there are guidelines for bullying and being mean?\n\nI do not understand why people in your community would want to destroy a person's only way to make a living after a severe injury which is helping clients get their properties repaired after fires floods and storms.\n\nIf anyone knows the answers to my questions, or if you can direct me to an email that I could contact someone to discuss this that can explain if I did something wrong or if peiple in your community did something unethical to me and you would like to see that people suffering out in the world do not get picked on by people in your community and or some assistance, my backup laptop could be unlocked still be unhacked they chabged the passcode,\n\nCan you please send me any emails to the people in Git that can assist me?\n\nPlease and thank you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Claim Handler"

Seldom is found,\n so many awesome styles and tracks all in one album. 17 song tracks with\n a whopping 55:24 minutes of pure musical enjoyment.\n\n  ChrisP Gavin's first album ( release-2015 'Live To Play' )  was a\n European, Australia success. It is still a mystery for the amount of\n sales success and large amassed following , there was little impact or\n coverage of ChrisP's album here in the U.S. of A. \n\n ChrisP's private Label;  'Buddy Boo Records' was said to have been too\n much of a distraction for other Major Labels.  Which made air time and \npromotional avenues a bit too risque for the competition.\n\n  \"No-One Plays Guitar Like I Do\" will be available at more that 200 \ndigital and physical locations throughout the continental America's ,\n Canada,  Europe , Australia , India and Asia."

In github.\nBut here \nWe try to connect with an international (online or cloud) operating system (ex a codebase r) where multiple people can interact, change the code(by request), copy the code (locally), or try something different parallely(branching).\n\nSince the code is online most people can visit and reach bigger audience and gets bettter updates. If open sourced.\n\n\nOr a team can work freely without worrying about going to office. Previously the cobe base is stored in an office. Or accessible from office.\n\n\nI hope this would have gaven better explanation than the video."

It is rumored that our store in Tampa was home to some of the first mountain bikes in the country. Cycling has changed dramatically as the decades have rolled by, but The Bike Spaces has never wavered from our total dedication to the sport.\nToday, The Bike Spaces is a growing family of bike shops, all with a singular purpose - to get as many people on bikes as possible. We operate twelve wildly successful stores in Tampa and Paris! Our professional staff of over 20 cycling enthusiasts will ensure that your experiences both in the store and on your bike are the best they can be.\nWhy shop with us? Because we know bikes and we care. We don't sell snowboards, we don't sell kayaks and we don't sell tents. We only sell bikes - you might even say bikes are our life. Why does that matter? Because this utter fanaticism for our product makes us the best at what we do - We live to create cyclists."
