Had you been so acquainted with your colonial oppression you wouldn't make such a remark of idiocy. And about the victim card well we were victims and just how your country suffers from  historical amnesia, mine don't because we definitely were at the receiving end of this oppression. We were looted of our wealth and henceforth, it is not an attempt to put your country under the bad light but it is a deliberate improvisation to actually show that colonial oppression left our country of wealth and prosperity in absolute plunder and now after 76 years of independence you play the escape card from the actual history."

Current Hindu regime in India opposes untouchablea war victory celebration against Hindu supermecists****\n\n\n***Christian law influenced English common law is the basis of legality in most countries, because the humanism was a concept lacking in most tribal animist and pagan religions****\n\n\n***Evil practices like human sacrifices, temple prostitution were opposed by Christian missionaries as well as the British raj***\n\n*** Hindu kings used to fight each other and just because Englishmen were more skilled, technologically advanced, better organized etc doesn't mean there is one such special thing as colonialism needs to be coined which didn't apply when a mongolian pillager or afghani warlord attack India.***\n\n***India was introduced to modern medicine instead of many superstition as such as applying cow dung to wound(mentioned in medical missionary Ida scudders biography)***\n\n***Administrative system unheard for India came into existence***\n\n***for first time modern engineering principles was put to use to create massive road network, rail, dam, administrative centres, plantations, ports, airports, military etc***\n\n***British didn't force convert Indians like the portugese catholics who failed.. If britain did, the whole India would be a christian nation now, because they could do that way before any organized anti british struggles arose in India***\n\n\n***Anti british sentiment was amongst the uppercaste feudals of India and people outside of upper caste levels. The Dalit(lowercaste) leaders like Ambedkar or Sri Narayana Guru of Kerala didn't see British as much as an oppressor as the Indian ruling uppercaste. Actually British were seen as liberators*** Yes there are odd instance of adivasi british fights too\n\n***Indian nationalist movement was initially a Hindu uppercaste movement headed by people like Tilak who was a maharashtrian Brahmin, who successors became hindumahasabha and RSS who even alligned with Hitler and later accused in murder of Gandhi***\n\n***India as we see today never existed, Britain created and instilled this sense of India just for the administrative ease of the region***\n\n\n***Thereby such a country without British rule would have been a different set of warring pricely states***\n\n."

Corruption within British officials, sadly, marred those intentions.\n\nIndia’s democratic journey is commendable, but it’s essential to recognize the role history played. The princely state era indeed had its challenges, and British arrival brought changes—some positive, some contested.\n\nIn a nuanced dialogue, let’s acknowledge that history’s impact is multifaceted, and Indians have, undeniably, harnessed advantages from the British rule."

They also sent loot abroad to invade Central Asia further but this is never taught in school text books. They had no rights to rule over Bharat Kingdoms to begin with. Mughals invaded laid waste to our lands, forcefully changed our culture religion, assaulted women and children and used Hindus money to build mosques and fund their expansion into more Hindu Kingdoms. Hindus also paid Jizaya tax, wealthy Hindus were either forced to convert or got their lands money daughters wives taken away. Jauhar was also because of them. They were worse than the British. At least the British left the libraries and temples alone. Not a single record of any British person demolishing temples. I don't care about the loot. The Mughals did more damage than the British did. Open calls for sharia ISIS recruitment Hindus being stoned love jeehad etc are problems India faces till today. Sati was only done by Queens who did not wish to live after their husbands died, out of love. Even today many people commit suicide out of heartbreak. It is not a new phenomenon. Nowhere in Hindu holy books Sati is mentioned. Rather the widows are urged to marry again and live happily. But after the Mughals invaded, they had to commit jauhar or lose their honor and become birthing machines and s*x slaves. Many women took their lives when they heard they were gonna be invaded by the Mughals and the British in their kingdoms. Open call for genocide rang in Kashmir and Kashmir pandit fled for their lives and still got killed or assaulted. We recently saw huge funeral possessions for a terrorist. Truly, I don't think in today's India, British or the Christians are that big of a problem. Pakistan was given for Muslim sake but still we have Muslims in India."

Indian Kings made beautiful palaces for themselves but general people were living a life of abject poverty. King's palaces didn't have any affect on general housing. India was exporter of hand-loom cloth but most of the population were living without proper dress. Cloth was a dear commodity. Thanks to mass production of industrial revolution, everyone could afford proper clothing.\nIt is wrong to assume that British got rich only due to proceeds from India. They already had America and South Africa before they put their feet in India. Buckingham palace was built in 1704 ( much earler than Robert Clive's assumption of power in Bengal). So far as right to loot is concerned, every incoming power would do that, Sashi Tharoor would have to compare the loot of Mehmood of Ghazna, Tamberlane, Nadir Shah, and Ahmed Shah Abdali  and then make such claims."

[he] charts the destruction of pre-colonial systems of government by the British and their ubiquitous ledgers and rule books ... The statistics are worth repeating. -- Victor Mallet ― Financial Times\n\nInglorious Empire is a timely reminder of the need to start teaching unromanticised colonial history in British schools. A welcome antidote to the nauseating righteousness and condescension pedalled by Niall Ferguson in his 2003 book Empire ― Irish Times\n\nHis writing is a delight and he seldom misses his target ... Tharoor should be applauded for tackling an impossibly contentious subject ... he deserves to be read. Indians are not the only ones who need reminding that empire has a lot to answer for. ― Literary Review\n\nRemarkable ... The book is savagely critical of 200 years of the British in India. It makes very uncomfortable reading for Brits -- Matt Ridley ― The Times\n\nTharoor's impassioned polemic slices straight to the heart of the darkness that drives all empires. Forceful, persuasive and blunt, he demolishes Raj nostalgia, laying bare the grim, and high, cost of the British Empire for its former subjects. An essential read -- Niljana Roy ― Financial Times\n\nFerocious and astonishing. Essential for a Britain lost in sepia fantasies about its past, Inglorious Empire is history at its clearest and cutting best -- Ben Judah\n\nThose Brits who speak confidently about how Britain's \"historical and cultural ties\" to India will make it easy to strike a great new trade deal should read Mr Tharoor's book. It would help them to see the world through the eyes of the ... countries once colonised or defeated by Britain -- Gideon Rachman ― Financial Times\n\nRare indeed is it to come across history that is so readable and so persuasive -- Amitav Ghosh\n\nEloquent ... a well-written riposte to those texts that celebrate empire as a supposed \"force for good\" ― BBC World Histories\n\nTharoor's book - arising from a contentious Oxford Union debate in 2015 where he proposed the motion \"Britain owes reparations to her former colonies\" - should keep the home fires burning, so to speak, both in India and in Britain. ... He makes a persuasive case, with telling examples ― History Today\n\nBrilliant ... A searing indictment of the Raj and its impact on India. ...

The time has come for the current British generation to acknowledge and pay back(at once) what their ancestors did to India and India people, during British colonialism, in the Indian sub-continent as exactly the current Germany did with one of the African countries, recently. No generational excuse can free the current Brits from the dark pages of their colonial past history. The UGLY FACT is that their school history books PRETEND they brought democracy and civilization during their colonial era to all continents, which indeed is a PRESUMPTION and a deliberate image washing tactic by the Brits to ease their conscience. Totally unacceptable the way they dared to claim their evil actions as ACT of GENEROSITY towards their ex-colonies, let alone towards the Indian subcontinent which marked the world's II ever civilization(Mohanjo Daro) way before the Brits were even born! One should visit the hidden CELLULAR JAIL(Andaman Nicobar Island) where Indian Freedom Fighters were tortured and hanged to death in the most brutal way by British Crown soldiers, during those 200 years!"

These people must be thinking that if people from non-European groups die of starvation then it is God's will because God has given the status of humans coming from European groups as superior humans while people from other groups deserve to be called animals.

The real and greater response of this is made by palki sharma where she quote that british took 45 trillion worth of money from india and they say about loan and also irony is india never took loan after 2017😂 I think british should revise their syllabus"
