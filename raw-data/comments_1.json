If you want to maximize your hypertrophy, it is much more effective to target your muscle group separately, for example doing a regular pushup will fatigue your chest and reach failure, same with pike pushups for shoulders and extensions for the triceps whereas if you combine all these moves in one set, either one of the three will burnout first and the remaining muscle groups won't reach true failure which is why targeting individual muscles is important.

    "Try this method and tell me if you like it: \nStart to do your exercises with the smallest surface possible. To progress from doing push-ups on your palm to doing them on the finger and toe tips. I started to grab dumbbells in the same manner just holding it with the tips of my fingers. My experience is that the recruitment of your muscles is much greater especially for grappling or any task that needs constant pressure from core to the finger tips. My result so far is a 2 finger 2 toe pushup - i want to do a handstand in this method and some other stuff - i even started to play table football with the fingertips and it worked better then i initially thought. If you want real fun do the exercises slower (at least aim for 1 min but strife for as long as you can) to get more time under tension for better results and a body that can still work smoothly under tension. Of course there are more benefits and exercise examples but this should give you a good start to do your own exploration 🤙🏼☀🙏🏼",

    "WHAT IS GYMNOPHOBIA?\n\n It is an obsession that has to do with the body.  In essence, it is the fear of nudity and it generates a lot of anguish and anxiety.\n\n Gymnophobia shows a general fear of nudity, either seeing other people naked or being seen naked or even a combination of both at the same time.  However, it is not the usual modesty that arises for this reason in society.  The irrational fear experienced by gymnophobics constitutes a pathology and supposes a limitation.  The problem prevents them from enjoying a healthy sexual life, but also from activities of daily existence, such as going to the beach or to the doctor, in which certain body exposure is necessary.\n\n Due to the cultural influence of psychoanalysis, there is a tendency to think that this phobia comes from a trauma.  But in reality it is not usually like that.  Gymnophobia is caused by erroneous cognitive schemes – for example, by the excessive tendency to compare oneself with others – or poorly adaptive emotions, in the case of the compulsive need to satisfy the expectations of others in order to feel loved.\n\n This leads to excessive self-criticism that prevents us from accepting our own body.\n The truth is that it can have very different causes.  Those who have experienced sexual trauma, for example, are at higher risk for this phobia, in part because they feel especially vulnerable when they are naked or experience nudity as a triggering event for that trauma.\n\n Similarly, fear of nudity can also be caused by being raised in a conservative culture or religion that discourages nudity and sexual expression.\n\n Children and adolescents can also develop this fear if they are bullied or shamed for some reason related to their bodies, for example if they are developing more or less rapidly than their peers.\n\n In many cases, in fact, this problem ends up leading to body dysmorphic disorders in which the person becomes obsessed with some part of their anatomy and can completely distort physical reality.  Fear of intimacy or feeling vulnerable is also a trigger.  Lastly, having surgical scars or other disfigurements can cause further body shaming which can easily turn into gymnophobia.\n\n The most effective treatment is psychotherapy.  A mix between relaxation techniques and systematic desensitization or progressive approach to the feared stimuli.\n\n Gymnophobia can be disabling in many cases, because something as simple as going to buy clothes at a shopping center can become a task that can be postponed indefinitely due to having common dressing rooms.  In a school setting, they may skip the shower after playing sports or even ask to have sex in total darkness, with the lights off.\n\n And it is that the fear of sex or sexual intimacy is included in a more generic category called \"genophobia\" or \"erotophobia\".  It is a condition that can cause intense fear or panic when sexual intimacy is attempted.  For some people, even thinking about it can cause these feelings.\n\n Nudity is beautiful do not feel afraid or afraid to show it.",

I am now going to subscribe, but odd that this popped up as just last night I was thinking of Karl Gotch (Catch wrestling legend) who really popularized the HIndu squat & pushup here in the West, & his training techniques for grappling. I had just decided I need to really increase the frequency & quantity I do these & see how it improves my conditiong, strength, & mobility as a 44 yo man that trains in BJJ, Muay Thai and is constantly dealing with Fibromyalgia so constant muscle & joint stiffness, & soreness that varies in severity, but after a long day of work working construction, training with weights or training in BJJ & Muay Thai 30 minutes after training or a lunch break at work, especially in the Winter when it is cold I get so tight that I am hunched over & move like my 85 yo grandfather..",

    "The wrestlers built the basis of their fitness around squats and pushups done for crazy amounts of sets that led to an extremely high amount of volume. This built, strength, stamina, endurance and flexibility all at the same time. They then added weights and additional exercises like dips, pullups, mace and dumbells. For those of us who aren't Indian wrestlers we can replicate this by simply doing lots and lots of pushups and squats and then add weights or harder variations of bodyweight exercises for lower amounts of sets sporadically. It builds a very functional body.",

For stamina benefits. \n\n\n  Can he do both, starting the day with amrap Oaol push up sets and then doing 10 sets of divebomber push ups?\n\n\n  As you understand these two are different for him in the sense that his max reps for these moves vary tremendously.....\n\n\n  Would doing divebombers for so many sets bring down his oaol push up max rep numbers even if he repeats another session after complete recovery? 🤔 \n\n\n\n  Or would doing both be totally fine? As long as he recovers in between sessions? \n\n\n  Would doing divebombers for more sets actually help him get stronger? Or would it hurt his max strength endeavours? Should he equalize the number of sets for these moves? Should he do one more than the other?\n\n\n\n  As you are a man who attributes your 150 kilo bench press to your push up training, and since we trust you tremendously, and since I only did oaol and one arm push ups mostly up until this time, I thought your personal experience and personal opinion would help us seek a better method to approach our endeavour.
