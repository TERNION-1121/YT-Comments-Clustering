I think we will unlock some of the secrets of the universe when we don't think of numbers like we do but instead assign values to observations and phenomenon that we can then use to prove other phenomenon that are unrelated removing numbers all together.

If so could anyone explain the origin, existence and uncanny applicability of abstract mathematics to the material universe? It is not a trick question. The late S.Hawking seems to think the Law of gravity created the universe out of nothing. What's your take on the major theme of his latest book? Do u think there is anything in the material realm that could be an actual infinite? See Dave Hilbert's verdict."

Really recommend Viharts video on the topic: 'Pi is (still) wrong'."

        "comment": "To an engineer the meaning of  the symbols of mathematics is a real function/action so let us explain this from the point of view of what vision an engineer sees. There is nothing imaginary to an engineer including the square root of (- 1)\n\ne^x=1+1+x/(1*2) + x^2/(1*2*3) ...........  represents the summation of a number of ever vectors all in the same direction and so the growth of a tree, the  growth of money in the bank, the radiation of atomic energy/ explosions,  are all natural functions where the element  added or subtracted is proportional to the  remaining mass.  This is basically a most natural function.\nBut in nature not everything grows in a straight line  and so engineers have to learn how to represent functions that do not grow in straight lines as branches in a plant or vines to make grapes.   Without going into much detail, the square root of (minus one) or (--1),  from an engineering point of view,  from  the location (1,0) on an X Y plot  one may get to the point represented by (-1,0) (minus one) through the point  (1,0) being rotated in two equal rotations operations of 90 degrees each, while the cube root of (-1)(minuns one) may be obtained through  the position (1,0) passing through three equal angular rotations of 60 degrees each.   This  rotation operation is very useful in engineering and so the square root of ( minus 1) can  be associated with a rotation of 90 degrees in a selected direction, say anticlockwise.  \n\nNow, e^jx= 1+jx +(jx)^2/(1*2) + (jx)^3/(1*2*3+  (jx)^4/(1*2*3*4)...................\n\nIt becomes clear that\nThe first term  1 is a vector which is not rotated.\nThe second term is a rotated vector by 90 degrees\nThe third term  is two rotations of 90 degrees bringing it around to 180 degrees\nThe fourth term is three rotations of 90 degrees bringing it around to 270 degrees\nThe fifth term is four rotations of 90  degrees bringing it around to 360 degrees\nThe sixth term will be five rotations of 90 degrees ........................ and so on and on.\nNow when x= pi  the summation of all these  rotating vectors come at (-1,0)  where pi originates from the fact that the circumference of a complete circle divided by the diameter is  pi= 3.142 approx. \n\n(  the even powers produce the vectors falling on the X axis  represent the cosine terms while the others odd powers falling on the Y axis  the sine terms \n\nThe total  engineering picture of all this is that there is a \" rotating spiral\"  where the trajectory  follows  points that are all located on the X and Y coordinates  so the vector summation of the rotating system is  somewhat like  a Corn's spiral  which ends up falling on the ( -1,0) location hence  e*(j*pi)+1=0"

Enthusiasm, passion, happiness, regardless of financial gains, and you could even say he is obsessed with numbers. Find your passion and get obsessed and you will be great. So many want to go into business school expecting to create some product that will sell millions, sorry to break it to you but you wont get far and you will be miserable. \nFind what you were born to do (EVERY SINGLE PERSON has a unique task they can be the best at, whatever it may be)."

It's like defining Euler's number to be e^2 instead of e so that a lot of identities with e and e^x lose their beauty. Pi has unarguably been defined wrongly, as the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of the circle, when it is the RADIUS that characterises the circle. Why are we arbitrarily defining it in terms of twice the radius? If pi was defined correctly, then then this equation would be e^(i pi)=1, which would be the most beautiful equation in math, without having to add in a forced 'under-simplification' (moving the -1 to the left) just so that it doesn't look ugly."
